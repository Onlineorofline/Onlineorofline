What is more important, the online or offline life?

The cost of On line life.

Each of us has different facets. Even when we are online or offline, are the same. But is true that we are more in reality, or are more ourselves when we are offline.

The Internet has given us the push out of the shell, by the fact that because people do not physically see us, gives us some confidence in ourselves, to say or do things that they normally would in the flesh. 

But what is a life through the screen? What is a life  where the hugs, the laughter and even the interaction is through emoticons? Where your friends are there but not.
The real life is out there, you can talk, you can hug, you can laugh and you can see in flesh the reactions of people, you can see if he or she it is truly laughing and hear you.

The internet and the computers, even Iphones and tablets are made for communicate, to approach people that can not be in the same place at the same time; is for learn and have fun, but now in days people prefer to be in front a computer, cell phone or ipad rather to be in front the real people.

Internet is wonderful, being  online is such a great thing, but at what cost?  some day we will not be able to talk in the crowd without something that support our own insecurity. 

Being near to someone and be touched, will seem awkward, even uncomfortable. Being online is making everything is important in life, fade away; the small details, feeling accompanied with someone next to you. To being able to watch a movie with somebody  without skype needs to be involved.

Being offline it´s what young people needs, it´s what everyone have to understand. We need to use internet and our " online us" without forget the meaning of life, without forgetting that is real people out there and that we need the physical interaction.

Some Facts

•	“The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society states that babies of 0-2 years should not have any contact with handheld devices (cell phones, tablets, electronic games), 3 to 5 years being restricted to one hour per day, and 6-18 years to 2 hours per day. According Cris Rowan, pediatric occupational therapist, biologist and writer "children and young people use these devices 4-5 times more than the recommended amount, with serious consequences and often threaten their health and life." 

•	“In Latin America children 6-9 years old, 35% have a mobile phone and the percentage increases to 89% among 10 to 18, according to the Interactive Generations study published by the Research Center for Media & Entertainment Industry in Latin America (Cimel).

•	Regarding use the guys give this MFP, the "talk by phone" seems to be the least important. Above this function are texting, listening to music, take pictures, and alarm clock.”

Why you should go outside when you can do something at your home?  They are many examples of this idea that came during the last years: food, services, transport, shopping and now relationship. Is really common know one person that has an online friend,  keeping this online relations is easier than have a real life relation, and a lot of people is taking this as an new way to know people. In one way it's easier to keep this kind of relationships but it's also harder, now your life depend from a mobile phone phone and a WiFi connection, in case that you're not online the feeling it's awful in a lot of ways, you're wondering what is your friend doing, does he miss me? Is she worried? Will he be angry? Maybe something happen and she need me. A lot of questions can cross your mind, why? Because this can be real, because with strangers that in one way you will never know you can't be judge and in one way you know it and because of that you don't need to impress somebody, you don't need the new iPhone or the last jeans, or doesn't matter if your hair looks awful and because of this you can be yourself, because someone in somewhere is just like you and it's wondering if you're out there and with the internet you can have that immediate connection with someone just like you.

The first steps to another life

Before we had the Internet, the closest form of written communication was the handwritten letters posted to our people or the talks without any distraction. Then there are the regular phone calls, family reunion meet-ups, parties, or the coffes with our friends, etc.. 
As a whole, these offline social interactions had more importance than what we are experiencing online today because we could at least hear the tone of voice through phone calls or read the body language and facial expression of the new person we have just met at the party. We have the example in front of our eyes. Can you see that people that are all the time with the cellphone and the other person are just talking?  That is the importance of technology, our cellphones and computer are tanking our lifes and we are not doing anything. 

To conclude

The online life has become more important than anything, we are just in front of the computer, including this moment, and we are just thinking to talk with a friend or your family, what are going to do? Take your phone an send them a whatssap, inbox or just a message to do the most important thing in the life TALK, agains to pass the quality time with that person you are just Laughing in front of the phone Without those eyes or thah smile… 
The worst thing is that kids today are growing up thinking that life is just about that, of being behind a screen.
